# api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll
This is an implementation of `api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll` based on code from the [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine) project. It is used in https://github.com/adang1345/PythonWin7 so that Python 3.9+ can run on Windows 7.

It is similar to https://github.com/nalexandru/api-ms-win-core-path-HACK/ but is more up-to-date with bug fixes and improvements from the Wine project.
